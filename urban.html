  <h1>Urban Modelling</h1>
  
  <p>DEFINE URBAN TRANSFORMATION: Developing city into a better place through constructing infrastructure which results in diversifying people, expanding land, creating freshwater reservoir and etc.</p>

    <a href="http://superflex.net/tools/superkilen/image/2#g">Superkilen Park</a>
    
   <p>Superkilen is a half a mile long urban space wedging through one of the most ethnically diverse and socially challenged neighborhoods in Denmark. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>
    <p>Key moves: Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants – requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>
    <p>Superkilen is divided into three main areas: The Red Square, The Black Market and The Green Park. While The Red Square designates the modern, urban life with café, music and sports, The Black Square is the classic square with fountain and benches. The Green Park is a park for picnics, sports and walking the dog. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>

    <p>SUPERFLEX asked local residents to nominate specific urban objects encountered in either their country of national origin or in their travels abroad, including benches, bins, trees, playgrounds, manhole covers and signage. The nominated objects were either produced as a 1:1 scale copy or purchased and transported to the Superkilen. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>
    <p>By bringing their own souvenirs from different countries, the residents would know different cultures as they live in local. This is one of the ways to achieve urban transformation,as it helps to diversify people through contact with unique items.</p>

    <p>Diversity is iconic for this park. It is what represents the park’s identity. About 98% of the local residents are either immigrant or born to immigrant families from more than 57 nationalities (mostly Middle Eastern and African) (Akšamija 2016, p. 15). The district Nørrebro has been known for many riots which took over the place for the past two centuries. There has been an incident where the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten had provoked some international controversy and worldwide protests, which resulted in burning of two Danish embassies, and riots and a boycott of Danish products in several countries (Akšamija 2016, p. 5). However, Superkilen Park has definitely contributed to narrowing gaps between diverse cultures.</p>
    <p>The local residents in Superkilen have a unique lifestyle with lots of opportunities to learn foreign culture. I would like to mention that Superkilen is next to a bicycle path that goes through the city for about 9 km. This makes cycling convenient as transport and it is further on connected with other lanes (People in Denmark love cycling) (VITAL CITIES, p. 22-23).</p>
