   <p>Superkilen is a half a mile long urban space wedging through one of the most ethnically diverse and socially challenged neighborhoods in Denmark.</p>
    <p>Key moves: Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants – requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select.</p>
    <p>Superkilen is divided into three main areas: The Red Square, The Black Square and The Green Park. While The Red Square designates the modern, urban life with café, music and sports, The Black Square is the classic square with fountain and benches. The Green Park is a park for picnics, sports and walking the dog.</p>
